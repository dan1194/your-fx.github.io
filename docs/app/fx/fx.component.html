                <p>It is the process of speculating currency prices to potentially make a profit.

                    trader is speculating which currency will fall and which currency will rise.
                    The value of a pair of currency is influenced by trade flows, economic,
                    geopolitical events which effects the demand and supply of foreign currency.</p>

                <h2>CA Afzal Lokhandwala</h2>
                <p>Afzal Lokhandwala is a <strong>stock trader who trades in the US and Indian markets.</strong> With
                    over 8 years of
                    experience, he is now a globally recognised trader having won the US Investing Championship in 2022.
                    He founded Champions Club to help ordinary working people become great traders with a robust trading
                    framework that requires minimal screen time, reduces stress, and is easy to understand.</p>
                <p>Afzal strongly advises traders to <strong>avoid intraday or options trading</strong> due to their low
                    success rates,
                    high stress, and more screen time making it unsuitable for ordinary people. <strong>Most of the real
                        successful traders with a long-term track record have made it big in stocks, not
                        options.</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Afzal possesses expertise in reading the price and volume behaviour (technical
                        analysis)</strong> of stocks as
                    the sole basis for his decision-making. Despite being a Chartered Accountant, he does not rely on
                    any sort of financial analysis (fundamental analysis) of stocks. This makes it possible for ordinary
                    people to understand and trade with his framework.</p>
                <p>With over 2200 people having gone through his programs and over 800,000 followers on social media,
                    Afzal has made a name for himself in the trading community.</p>
